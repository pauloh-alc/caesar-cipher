## What is the Caesar Cipher? Ô∏è

In cryptography, a Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

For example, with a three-position swap, 'A' would be replaced by 'D', 'B' would become 'E', and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it to communicate with his generals.

1) Alphabet
2) Shifted Alphabet

1. ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
2. DEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABC

## Example

```sh
Plaintext:  THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG
Ciphertext: QEB NRFZH YOLTK CLU GRJMP LSBO QEB IXWV ALD
